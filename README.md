# Embedded Live Code

This repository contains the production version of ELC. You can learn more about
what ELC does [here](https://github.com/cs-education/elc-dev).

In this repository, you will find the production files `elc.js` and `jor1k-worker-min.js`,
as well as the necessary filesystem directory `sys`. You need each of these in order to run
ELC properly in your website.
